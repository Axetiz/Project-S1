# Project‑S1 / OrbitSimLite

This repository contains **Project‑S1**, whose main component is the `OrbitSimLite` C++17 library and demo suite for 2D Newtonian orbits.

OrbitSimLite was implemented by **Axetiz** and **ArameGevorgyan** as an educational physics and rendering project.

## Structure

- `OrbitSimLite/` – self‑contained N‑body simulation + SFML visualisation library
  - public headers under `OrbitSimLite/include/`
  - core sources under `OrbitSimLite/src/`
  - demos and tests under `OrbitSimLite/examples/` and `OrbitSimLite/tests/`
- top‑level files – repository metadata and additional project artefacts

For detailed documentation, build instructions, demo descriptions, and library usage examples, see:

- `OrbitSimLite/README.md`

That README is the canonical reference for how to configure, build, and use the OrbitSimLite library and its demos.
